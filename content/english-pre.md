<!-- _header: Introduction -->

This paper investigates the prevalence and factors contributing to **overweight, obesity, and central obesity** among adults in Shenmu City. By analyzing data from 4,565 residents, it found high prevalence rates, with **significant associations between these conditions and factors like age, gender, education level, and chronic diseases**, providing crucial insights for developing effective prevention strategies.

<!--
Basically, In this article, author use t-test and chi-square to determine whether two factors are statistically significant, and use multivariable logistic regression to analyzer the data collect by questionnaire and body measurements in shenmu citys, and found this assocations.

Overweight, obesity, and central obesity are characterized as chronic metabolic disorders stemming from excessive total fat accumulation and/or localized fat increase with abnormal distribution. These conditions are commonly influenced by a synergy of **genetic and environmental** factors (Wei et al., 2022, Panuganti et al., 2022).

**provide brief background information**

<!--Firstly, provide some defination and breif background info, like overweight relative to genetic or environmental factor-->

In recent years, the prevalence of these conditions has **escalated into a global public health concern** due to economic advancement and improved living standards
In 2016, it was reported that over 1.9 billion adults worldwide, aged 18 
and older, were overweight, with more than 650 million classified as 
obese. The Report on Nutrition and Chronic Diseases in China (2020) 
indicates that **34.3%** of Chinese adults are **overweight**, and **16.4%** are **obese**, *highlighting the significant public health challenge these conditions pose both globally and within China.*

**The grim situation in domestic -> The need of research**

The impact of overweight, obesity, and central obesity extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being significantly.  Research indicates a **higher propensity for mental health issues**, particularly anxiety and depression, among those affected by these conditions (Fulton et al., 2022). Moreover, overweight and obesity are not only chronic conditions in their own right but are also associated with **a myriad of other chronic diseases** including *diabetes, stroke, coronary artery disease, hypertension, respiratory diseases, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and gallstones* (Zhang et al., 2013, Powell-Wiley et al., 2021, Ibrahim and El-Sayed, 2021, Parra-Landazury et al., 2021).

**Obesity can lead to a lot of diseases -> The important of research**

Furthermore, there is a well-documented link between obesity and an **increased risk of various cancers**, such as breast, colorectal, liver, among others (Larsson and Burgess, 2021, Maguire et al., 2021, Lee et al., 2019, Ma et al., 2013, Parida et al., 2019). Notably, studies have also identified obesity as a **significant independent risk factor for adverse outcomes**, including mortality, in cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, with the severity of outcomes correlating with the degree of obesity (Simonnet et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2021).

**Obesity can lead to a lot of diseases -> The important of research**

While the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and central obesity is widespread and affects all populations, significant geographical disparities exist. **Despite numerous studies, there is a lack of large-scale data on the prevalence of these conditions in Shenmu City**, Shaanxi Province. Thus, our study aims to assess the relationship between various risk factors and the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and central obesity among 4,565 adult residents of Shenmu City. The findings are expected to guide the development of health living guidelines for the local population and provide theoretical support for crafting relevant public health prevention policies.

>  Moreover, overweight and obesity are not only 
chronic conditions in their own right but are also associated with a 
myriad of other chronic diseases including *diabetes, stroke, coronary 
artery disease, hypertension*, **respiratory diseases, obstructive sleep 
apnea**, *osteoarthritis, and gallstones* (Zhang et al., 2013, Powell-Wiley et al., 2021, Ibrahim and El-Sayed, 2021, Parra-Landazury et al., 2021).

Based on a review of the literature, there is no description of respiratory diseases found in any of the articles cited here.

<!-- _header: Evalutation -->

**Gap: Despite numerous studies, there is a lack of large-scale data on the prevalence of these conditions in Shenmu City, Shaanxi Province.**

<!-- 
Let's go back to the gap of research we just talked about here.
the gap is although there is a lot of relative aritcles about other place,
Since the region is an important factor influencing the results of the study, Shenmu needs such a study.

However, the article does not quote any previous articles to evaluate its 
methodology or factors they found maybe relative to overweight.
